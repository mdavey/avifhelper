# AVIF Helper

Super basic Python UI for compressing a JPEG/PNG to AVIF at a target size.

There is nothing clever here.  It just uses ImageMagick to try a few quality settings and picks the one under the 
specified goal size.  Will resize large images to somewhere around 1600x1200.

It's meant to be super simple.  If you want the best quality then use [https://squoosh.app/](Squoosh).  It's amazing.

Windows only (Uses Windows API for spawning processes correctly from a frozen TK program).  

**Does** correctly freeze to a single 17MB exe (including `magick.exe` binary).

## Issues

No thread when launching `magick` so the UI will freeze while it's compressing the image.  There's also no way to 
stop it (without closing the program).

The 42Kb target is hardcoded.

Program only tries a set list of quality settings, can't adapt to results and make finer adjustments

No drag and drop for opening images.
