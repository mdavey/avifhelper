## AVIF Helper

Super basic Python UI for compressing a JPEG/PNG to AVIF at a target size.

There is nothing clever here.  It just uses `avifenc` to try a few quality settings and picks the one under the 
specified goal size.

Windows only.  Requires a `avifenc` binary.

**Does** correctly freeze to a single 13MB exe (including `avifenc` binary).
